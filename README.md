Part - 1

These are 10 basic core java programs.
Some programs have been solved using Java 8.

1) print helloworld 10 times.
    o/p=  Hello world 1
          Hello World 2 ....  
          Hello World 10
2) print the 3rd highest from array.
3) reverse a given string. i/p="Reverse"
4) write a code to find missing number in Integer List
    Test cases :
       a) 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10
       b)2,4,6,10,12,14,16,18,20
       c)1,3,5,9,11,13,15,17
5) Write a program to get the occurrence of a specific letter in a given String.
   i/p="Hello"
   i/p=l
   o/p=2 
6) Write a java program for palindrome in normal way as well as using Command line arguments.
  i/p="MADAM"
  o/p MADAM is a Pallendrome

7) Write a program to sort a given list of intergers in ascending order
  i/p list={2,4,0,1,56,23,4}
  o/p list={0,1,2,4,4,23,56}
8) Write a program to check a given number is prime or not 
    i/p n=34
9) write a program to a sort a Array of String in ascending oreder alphabetially
   i/p String s=["Capgemini","Accenture","TCS","EPAM"]
   o/p =[Accenture,Capgemini,EPAM,TCS]
10) Write a program to check a given number is even or odd
    i/p n=34
    o/p = 34 is even number
